# Predicting-prices-of-used-cars

This was a coding unit on machinehack wherein two data sets - the train and test datasets were given.
The Jupyter notebook contains the code for everything - data cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, required imputations.
I've used multiple algorithms like Linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression,neural networks, xgboost, random forest, for prediction. 
The code is well commented.
